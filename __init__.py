Dual-Agent Actor-Critic Architecture for Automated Game Planning

This system transforms simple game concepts into comprehensive Game Design Documents (GDD)
using a dual-agent approach where:
- Game Designer Agent (Actor, t=0.6) generates creative, detailed game designs
- Game Reviewer Agent (Critic, t=0.2) validates feasibility, completeness, coherence

Based on the Dual-Agent Actor-Critic architecture from arXiv:2512.10501
